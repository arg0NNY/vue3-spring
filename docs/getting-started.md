# Vue 3 Spring

A spring-physics based animation library, in addition to more components, to cover most of the UI related animations, when CSS is not enough for you.
It shipped with Composition-API-friendly [animation functions](/animation-functions) to support model-based API, in additional to [animation components](/animation-components) for the ones who prefer the template-based way
This library represents the Vue3 alternative for [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) and [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion).
